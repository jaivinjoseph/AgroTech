          <h className="dont">→ DO NOT BURN BUSH WHEN CLEARING YOUR FARM.</h>
          <h className="dont-1">
            Burning bush in the farm not only affects the soil, it also has
            adverse effects on climate change. It exposes the land to the effect
            of wind, water erosion and ultraviolet radiation.<br></br>
            Instead of burning the bush, you can gather them and use them as
            mulch to protect the soil or manure to provide nutrients to the
            soil.

            → MAKE RIDGES WHEN PLANTING CROPS ON YOUR FARM INSTEAD OF FLAT LAND.
          </h>
          <h className="mak-3">
            Ridging is the gathering of soil from the sides, channelling it
            towards the centre, so as to create a pile of raised soil with a
            trapezoidal contour. Ridges help to improve soil health, reduce
            erosion, runoff and make weeding easier for farmers. Thereby
            ensuring you have optimal produce during harvest

            → PLANT COVER CROPS ON YOUR FARM TO ENRICH YOUR SOIL WITH NUTRIENTS.
          </h>
          <h className="pla-3">
            Planting cover crops before your intended planting season or before
            planting your main crops as a form of crop rotation will do your
            soil a lot of good. Cover crops help prevent soil erosion, regulate
            moisture, attract pollinators, assist in weed and pest management,
            serve as mulch and the source of green manure and organic matter.
            They help improve soil health. Beans, cowpeas, wheat, barley are
            examples of cover crops you can consider planting in your farm.

            → WHEN CULTIVATING A LARGE PIECE OF LAND, MAKE USE OF AGRICULTURAL
            TECHNOLOGY.
          </h>
          <h className="whe-3">
            Cultivating a large piece of land often means more profit than the
            average Nigerian farmer, however, if you are using traditional farm
            tools, it may result in more loss than profit and you may be unable
            to utilise the land properly. You will also need to employ more
            hands to work on the farm with you. However, using farm machinery
            like a tractor will enable you to get the job done faster for
            farming activities such as, ploughing, tilling, harrowing and
            planting. Using an herbicide instead of manually weeding with your
            hands, will help you weed your farm efficiently.

          </h>
          <h className="tre-3">
            It is important to keep yourself updated about the latest farming
            news, technologies and trends that can possibly impact your farming
            activities. Associate with other farmers or join a farmers’
            association related to the type of farming you are into, it is
            especially useful when there are special grants, seeds, fertilisers
            and other farming inputs that may be supplied by the government,
            NGOs and or other corporate bodies. You will also get to learn from
            other farmers when you run into challenges.
